## Problem description

This puzzle, published by Mickaël Launay [@lemonde2025polychoco], boils down to finding a tiling of a $5\times 10$
grid using different [pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino).

We will represent the grid as 2d grid graph (where a cell is a node):

<div class="embed-scale-50">
{{< embed notebooks/pentominoes.ipynb#e9eb5cf4-fb11-4653-b958-e7a95b6e5ff4 >}}
</div>

The candidate pentominoes are the $8$ Y pentominoes:

## MIP model


#### Parameters

- $C$: set of cells of the grid
- $P$: set of candidate pentominoes. A pentomino $p$ is defined as a subgraph of the grid; 
therefore it is defined not only by its shape, but also by the set of nodes it covers. 

#### Variables

- $\textcolor{blue}{x}_{i} \in \{0,1\}$: takes value $1$ if and only if pentomino $p\in P$ is used

#### Objective function

As this is a feasibility problem, any dummy objective function is suitable:

$$
\min 0
$$

subject to:

#### Constraints

- Each cell (node) of the grid (graph) must be covered exactly once, 
by one of the candidate pentaminoes:

\begin{align}
\sum_{p \in P|c \in p}\textcolor{blue}{x}_{p}=1 \quad \forall c \in C \\
\end{align}


## Solution

Solving this problem takes less than a second with the default solver
in [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) (CBC) and yields:
